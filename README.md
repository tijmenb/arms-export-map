# Arms export map

This is an attempt to visualise the arms export licenses issued by the Dutch government between 2004 and 2014.

[You can see it in action here](https://tijmenb.github.io/arms-export-map/).

The data comes from [this data set provided by @arjanelfassed](https://arjanelfassed.github.io/dutcharmsexports/). For now it only uses the ["Rapportages uitvoer militaire goederen"](https://github.com/tijmenb/arms-export-map/blob/gh-pages/source/Overzicht.uitvoer.militaire.goederen.2004-2014.csv), not doesn't contain the other two data sets yet.

### Caveats

- Some licenses are missing because the country names are not consistent.
- Some licenses are issued for multiple countries. In this case the first mentioned country has been (arbitrarily) picked.
- Some licenses are for country groups like the EU. These have been left out of the visualisation.
